Microsoft SQL Server analysis on a crash database

## Description

This repository contains a collection of SQL projects that cover various queries related to a hypothetical traffic accident database. The assignments focus on extracting meaningful insights and statistics from the dataset using SQL queries.

**Motivation:**
- The primary motivation behind these assignments is to practice and demonstrate proficiency in SQL query writing.
  
**Problem Solving:**
- The assignments address real-world scenarios related to traffic accidents, such as identifying specific crash conditions, analyzing driver actions, and understanding the distribution of crashes across different parameters.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Gain hands-on experience in crafting complex SQL queries.
- Understand how to retrieve, filter, and aggregate data from multiple tables in a relational database.
- Apply SQL concepts to solve practical problems related to traffic accidents.

## Installation
